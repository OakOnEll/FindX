rotate restarts music

Doesn't continue pending puzzle?  

add more levels
First couple stages should follow simple algebra order?

finish a custom level, different text? Include the custom level url?!

share custom level
  progress/task disappears when change orientation   
   
   
   Sharing built level text in preferences
 
 
some action buttons layout poorly and block the text on the button


later
-----
share custom level
  progress/task disappears when change orientation
  can "go back" from "puzzle already optimal" "OK" dialog into odd searching dialog   

  Enable add random moves only when applicable   
on settings preferences, item to visit/rate app
 
 
 
 Fixed
 ----
 stage doesn't unlock when previous finished?
  -1x in expression display
 android:layout_margin="4dp"
   divide/multiply by zero
   warn of optimizing "too" many moves puzzle
  warn before save if not "optimized"
  allow accepting early found solutions  
  restart level from finish dialog, close dialog then erase (right now dialog stays up)
  slow fade/erase animation for undo a move
next level from finish dialog, close dialog then erase whole screen
 erase for next level, as well?
 don't erase background for next level  (layout complexity)
  don't erase equation on restart
    restart same level erase- don't erase the starting equation?
 delay finish of level for writing animation.
  short undo erase sound
 longer restart erase sound
  doesn't scroll on phone when new move added
  restart didn't confirm?
   disable restart when only one move and no undos used
   don't animate erase on restart if no moves 
 move saving broken?
  eg, rotate phone, loses moves
 about formatting
 store solutions for all levels
   (with junit tests to assure correct, and optimal if possible)
   delete custom level... deletes wrong level?
 back from loaded puzzle crashes
 lock stages until previous
 move level 1-12 to very end
   enable/disable minimize moves based on model's optimized property
    and/or  display optimized property in readonly textview
   externally loaded levels are not editable/copyable (so as not to cheat at the solution...)
    separate "imported" stage?  
  add author to export/import
     import fails to launch level
    (something about the dbId versus the stage level id)
